# Task Objectives

This project aims to predict whether a customer will discontinue a subscription-based service. The model is trained using historical customer data, including:
   Usage patterns
   Demographic details
   Subscription duration

The goal is to identify at-risk customers and provide insights into key churn factors.

First Importing Libraries for data processing, visualization, machine learning model training, and evaluation.
Then load the dataset and removes unnecessary columns that don't contribute to prediction.
Scales numerical data and splits the dataset into training and testing sets.
Trains a **RandomForestClassifier** to predict customer churn. Predicts churn and evaluates model performance.
Displays important features affecting churn prediction.

# Key Features
   Uses RandomForestClassifier for churn prediction.
   Implements feature scaling and encoding.
   Provides feature importance insights to understand churn behavior.
